# This program takes a list containing values (words) and outputs the most occoring value.
# If multiple values (words) occor the same amount of times, it will output the the value (word) with the latest first occorence in the list.
#
# Parameter "n" of the function "most_frequent_word" is the list of values (words) to be checked. Note there is no type checking and assumes input is a list of strings.
# Prints either error of empty array or the most frequent value (word).
#
# Variable "most_word" is the most occorinf value in the list.
# variable "max_frequency" is the number of times the "mostWord" has occored.
# vairable "current_frequency" is the number of times the currently selected value has occored in the list.
#
# e.g.  most_frequent_word([]) = Error: empty array.
#       most_frequent_word([1,2,3,4,5,4,3,5,4,3,2,"cheese","green","cheese"]) = Most frequent word is: 3 . Occurrences: 3 .
#       most_frequent_word(["purple","cheese", "and","toast", "water"]) = Most frequent word is: water . Occurrences: 1 .
#       most_frequent_word(['purple','chess','purple', 'welcome','chess','welcome']) = Most frequent word is: welcome . Occurrences: 2 .
#       most_frequent_word(['coffee','coffee','abc','abc', 'hello', 'hello', 'welcome']) = Most frequent word is: hello . Occurrences: 2 .
#       most_frequent_word(['purple','and', 'and','toast', 'water','purple','purple']) = Most frequent word is: purple . Occurrences: 3 .
